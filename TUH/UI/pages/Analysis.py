        It is possible to analyze the structure of the considered epileptic EEG signal in the time domain as well as the changes in amplitude and frequency of the signal during the day. These transient events point to abnormal neural activity and are generally linked with the synchronizing of huge numbers of neurons. The number of such episodes proves that there is an elevated level of brain hyper-excitability which is characteristic of epilepsy.

        On the other hand, the time-domain analysis of the non-epileptic EEG signal is relatively much more organized, and the noise has lesser tendency. The amplitude fluctuations are lesser and less in number which indicates a rhythmical oscillation in the neuronal behaviour. This pattern is very similar to normal brain function wherein neurons are firing in a coordinated way.

        The power spectral density plot of the epileptic EEG indicates a quite typical features of this type of signals, most notably a shift in the content towards higher frequencies of around 30 - 60 Hz. This increased activity in these frequency bands usually linked to gamma waves suggests that the brains neural firing is out of sync and that there are higher firing rates – both symptomatic of epileptic seizures.

        Whereas, the PSD plot of the non-epileptic EEG signal reveals another peak lying in the lower frequency band and which can be typical for alpha and theta waves and which is below than 20Hz. Lack of pattern is much similar to normal control recording and hence explains more of a regular pattern of brain activity. The lack of much energy at the higher frequencies also provides evidence for a healthy brain state.

These fast oscillations also known as gamma waves present itself as increased neuronal synchronization and can be seen during seizures. Further, the spectrogram reveals less continuous oscillation indicating transient period of enhanced neuronal coherency.
